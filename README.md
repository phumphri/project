## CREDIT: It's important
<p>Your credit score is incredibly important and impacts your quality of life. Building credit and maintaining a high credit score is incredibly important as loans are necessary for many investments such as purchasing a home or a car. </p>

<p> Building great credit can be difficult as variables that are outside ones control such as age of credit history influence ones credit score. </p>

<p> Herein we strive to unviel ones abilty to pay back thier loan by analyzing variables that are not dependenct upon credit score. </p>

<p> This exploration is an exercise for the Home Credit Default Risk competition on Kaggle sponsored by Home Credit Group. </p>
